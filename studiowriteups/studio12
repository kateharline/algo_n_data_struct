The DemoCaesar class picks a random rotation value between 0 and 25, inclusively. What would happen if it chose a value outside that range? For example, 26 or 27?
it would be mod-ed with 26 so would only yield a number 0-25

You can try this by assigning rot a fixed value such as 26 and run the DemoCaesar class again.

What would happen if you supplied the value 247?
it's fine
